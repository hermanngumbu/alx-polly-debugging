# ALX Polly: A Polling Application

Welcome to ALX Polly, a full-stack polling application built with Next.js, TypeScript, and Supabase. This project serves as a practical learning ground for modern web development concepts, with a special focus on identifying and fixing common security vulnerabilities.

## About the Application

ALX Polly allows authenticated users to create, share, and vote on polls. It's a simple yet powerful application that demonstrates key features of modern web development:

-   **Authentication**: Secure user sign-up and login.
-   **Poll Management**: Users can create, view, and delete their own polls.
-   **Voting System**: A straightforward system for casting and viewing votes.
-   **User Dashboard**: A personalized space for users to manage their polls.

The application is built with a modern tech stack:

-   **Framework**: [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) (App Router)
-   **Language**: [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/)
-   **Backend & Database**: [Supabase](https://supabase.io/)

## ðŸš€ The Challenge: Security Audit & Remediation

As a developer, writing functional code is only half the battle. Ensuring that the code is secure, robust, and free of vulnerabilities is just as critical. This version of ALX Polly has been intentionally built with several security flaws, providing a real-world scenario for you to practice your security auditing skills.

**Your mission is to act as a security engineer tasked with auditing this codebase.**

### Your Objectives:

1.  **Identify Vulnerabilities**:
    -   Thoroughly review the codebase to find security weaknesses.
    -   Pay close attention to user authentication, data access, and business logic.
    -   Think about how a malicious actor could misuse the application's features.

2.  **Understand the Impact**:
    -   For each vulnerability you find, determine the potential impact.Query your AI assistant about it. What data could be exposed? What unauthorized actions could be performed?

3.  **Propose and Implement Fixes**:
    -   Once a vulnerability is identified, ask your AI assistant to fix it.
    -   Write secure, efficient, and clean code to patch the security holes.
    -   Ensure that your fixes do not break existing functionality for legitimate users.

### Security Audit Findings & Remediation

During the security audit, several potential attack vectors were identified and subsequently remediated. This section outlines the discovered flaws and the steps taken to address them.

#### 1. Authorization Bypass Vulnerabilities

**Description**: Initially, several Server Actions lacked robust authorization checks, allowing unauthorized users to potentially view, update, or delete polls they did not own.
    -   `getPollById` did not verify poll ownership, enabling any user with a poll ID to view its details.
    -   `deletePoll` allowed any authenticated user to delete any poll by knowing its ID.
    -   `updatePoll` (via `EditPollPage.tsx`) could potentially render edit forms for non-owners.
    -   `submitVote` allowed unauthenticated voting and did not prevent duplicate votes.

**Remediation**:
    -   **`getPollById` and `deletePoll`**: Modified to include explicit checks (`.eq("user_id", user.id)`) to ensure only the authenticated owner can access or delete their polls.
    -   **`submitVote`**: Enhanced to require user login, validate `pollId` format and `optionIndex` range, and prevent duplicate votes from the same user on the same poll by checking for existing votes.
    -   **`EditPollPage.tsx`**: Updated to leverage the hardened `getPollById` function, preventing the rendering of the edit form for polls not owned by the current user.

#### 2. Information Disclosure (Error Messages)

**Description**: Raw error messages from Supabase were being directly exposed to the client in various Server Actions. This could potentially reveal sensitive internal system information or database structure to attackers.

**Remediation**:
    -   **`auth-actions.ts` and `poll-actions.ts`**: All Server Actions were updated to return generic, user-friendly error messages (e.g., "Invalid credentials.", "Failed to create poll.") instead of direct Supabase error messages, limiting information leakage.

#### 3. Inadequate Server-Side Input Validation

**Description**: The `createPoll` and `updatePoll` Server Actions had only basic length validation for poll questions and options, making them susceptible to malformed data or potential injection attacks (though mitigated by Supabase's ORM).

**Remediation**:
    -   **`createPoll` and `updatePoll`**: Implemented comprehensive server-side input validation for poll questions (length 1-255 characters) and options (at least two options, each 1-100 characters long, and trimmed). This helps prevent malicious or malformed data from being persisted.
    -   **`submitVote`**: Added specific validation for `pollId` (ensuring it's a string) and `optionIndex` (ensuring it's within the valid range of poll options).

#### 4. Client-Side Open Redirect

**Description**: The application used `window.location.href` for client-side redirections after certain actions (login, registration, poll creation/editing). While the targets were hardcoded in this instance, using `window.location.href` with dynamic, untrusted input could lead to open redirect vulnerabilities.

**Remediation**:
    -   **Client-Side Redirections**: All instances of `window.location.href` for internal navigation in `LoginPage.tsx`, `RegisterPage.tsx`, `PollCreateForm.tsx`, and `EditPollForm.tsx` were replaced with `next/navigation`'s `useRouter().push()`. This is a safer method for handling internal navigation within a Next.js application.

#### 5. Supabase Row Level Security (RLS) Misconfiguration (Critical Configuration Step)

**Description**: This is a critical configuration-level vulnerability that cannot be addressed directly within the codebase. Without properly configured Row Level Security (RLS) policies directly within the Supabase database, an attacker could bypass application-level authorization checks and directly access, modify, or delete data through the Supabase API, even with the server-side code remediations in place.

**Remediation (Action Required)**:
    -   **Manual Configuration in Supabase Dashboard**: It is imperative to **manually verify and configure your Row Level Security policies** in your Supabase dashboard for all relevant tables (e.g., `polls`, `votes`, `users`). Ensure RLS is enabled and policies are correctly defined to enforce:
        -   Users can only read their own polls or publicly shared polls.
        -   Users can only create, update, or delete polls they own.
        -   Users can only create a vote if they haven't already voted on that poll.
        -   Users can read vote counts for polls.
        -   Sensitive user data is protected.

**This step is crucial for the complete security of the application and must be performed directly in your Supabase project.**

### Where to Start?

A good security audit involves both static code analysis and dynamic testing. Hereâ€™s a suggested approach:

1.  **Familiarize Yourself with the Code**:
    -   Start with `app/lib/actions/` to understand how the application interacts with the database.
    -   Explore the page routes in the `app/(dashboard)/` directory. How is data displayed and managed?
    -   Look for hidden or undocumented features. Are there any pages not linked in the main UI?

2.  **Use Your AI Assistant**:
    -   This is an open-book test. You are encouraged to use AI tools to help you.
    -   Ask your AI assistant to review snippets of code for security issues.
    -   Describe a feature's behavior to your AI and ask it to identify potential attack vectors.
    -   When you find a vulnerability, ask your AI for the best way to patch it.
